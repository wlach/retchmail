.SH NAME
retchmail \- The world's most stupidly fast POP3 retriever.


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B retchmail
.I "-d | -dd | -q | -qq | -c | -V | -F | -t deliverto | fromacct..."

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B retchmail
is a stupidly fast mail retriever, similar to the
.BR fetchmail (1)
program, except that it is blazingly fast, and only handles POP3 and POP3s
(POP3 over SSL).
.PP
When
.B retchmail
starts, it first loads its configuration from
.IR ~/.retchmailrc ,
which contains basic information about the accounts, mailboxes, etc.
.PP
It will then go out and retrieve all of the mail from those accounts. 
.PP

.TP
.I "\-c \fR[\|\fIconfigfile\fR\|]
Run retchmail with configfile as the configuration file (instead of
